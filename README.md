# Pandemic-BoardGame
A Java project for creating and playing the Pandemic Board Game through automatic agents

##Purpose
Created in Eclipse IDE for an undergraduate project in lesson called "Autonomous Agents".

##Brief Description
Given the board game logic in Java, we had to improve the default agent behavior for playing the board game. The target was to improve the strategic movements of each agent (i.e. character of the game).
The improvements were primarily made according to the ability of each character and the strategic plan to manage to win on time.

##Pandemic Board Game
Pandemic is a cooperative board game.Pandemic is based on the premise that four diseases have broken out in the world, each threatening to wipe out a region. The game accommodates two to four players, each playing one of seven possible roles: dispatcher, medic, scientist, researcher, operations expert, contingency planner, or quarantine specialist. Through the combined effort of all the players, the goal is to discover all four cures before any of several game-losing conditions are reached.
